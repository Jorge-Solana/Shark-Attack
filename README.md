# Shark Attack
[portada](../../shark_meme.jpg)
## What is this project about?
This project is an attemp of finding good and usable values in a certain data set (not quite clean), for that, clean it and make some aproaches about the hypothesis that will be later commented.


## Approach

Given the raw shark attack data set, the first thing to do was to check the ammount of usable values we had... lots of nulls!. 
Therefore, knowing whcih rows were going to be useful for our studies, we had to do some intense cleaning.
After the cleaning was done, we used seaborn to make some graphics to prove (or not) our thoughts were on the right path about shark attack.


## Hypothesis
### 1. The variance of attacks per year per country. Is Austrlia the most attacked country?
### 2. The proportion between unprovoked and provoked attacks... Wondering which of 3 most attacked countries is the most provocative
### 3. Swimming and diving may be the most attacked activities but... what about surfing?
### 4. White sharks are the most aggresive amongst all the sharks
